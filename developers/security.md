## Bug Bounty

We have an ongoing [bug bounty on ImmuneFi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/ribbon/), with up to $50,000 of bounty. The contracts that are included in the bounty are ETH and WBTC Theta Vaults.

## Audits

Ribbon's Theta Vault is audited. To be specific, below are the contracts that were audited:

* [RibbonFactory](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/structured-products/blob/master/contracts/RibbonFactory.sol)
* [GammaAdapter](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/structured-products/blob/master/contracts/adapters/GammaAdapter.sol)
* [RibbonThetaVault](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/structured-products/blob/master/contracts/instruments/RibbonThetaVault.sol)

The rest of the smart contract code released by Ribbon are not audited yet and should be treated as alpha software. We advice users to exercise caution and to not risk funds they are not willing to lose.
