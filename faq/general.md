# General

### What are structured products?

[Structured products](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/structured\_products.asp) are packaged financial instruments that use a combination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, such as betting on volatility, enhancing yields or principal protection.

### What is the risk of the covered-call vault?

The primary risk for running a covered-call strategy is that depositors could potentially give up upside in exchange for guaranteed yield. By selling a call option users are essentially promising to sell the asset at the strike price even if the price rises. This may result in a negative yield on the underlying asset. However, in that case depositors will still be up in USD terms, as the underlying asset would have appreciated significantly in a short period of time.

### What is the risk of the put-selling vault?

The primary risk for running a put-selling strategy is that the vault may incur a weekly loss in the case where the put options sold by the vault expire in-the-money (meaning the price of the underlying asset is below the strike price of the put options minted by the vault).

### What is the options infrastructure used by the vaults?

Ribbon options are built on the Opyn V2 protocol, even on Avax.

### Is Ribbon multichain?

We're currently on Ethereum mainnet, Avalanche, and Solana. There are currently no plans to expand to further chains.
