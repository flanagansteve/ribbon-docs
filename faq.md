# FAQ

## What are structured products?

Structured products are packaged financial instruments that use a combination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, such as betting on volatility, enhancing yields or principal protection.

## Does Ribbon have a token?

Yes, Ribbon has a governance token, RBN. Please read the [RBN announcement blog post](https://ribbonfinance.medium.com/decentralizing-ribbon-governance-395950da7a6) for more details. The RBN token is [0x6123B0049F904d730dB3C36a31167D9d4121fA6B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6123b0049f904d730db3c36a31167d9d4121fa6b). The token is currently not tradable, so it is not available on any DEXes.

## What is the security of Ribbon contracts?

Our v2 Solidity contracts are audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/ribbon-finance-audit/) and [ChainSafe](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/audit/blob/master/reports/RibbonThetaVault%20V2%20Smart%20Contract%20Review%20And%20Verification.pdf).

Users are encouraged to only risk funds that they are willing to lose.

We have a bug bounty for Ribbon's deployed smart contracts on Ethereum. Please refer to the [Security page](developers/security.md#bug-bounty) for more details.
