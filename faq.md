# FAQ

## What are structured products?

Structured products are packaged financial instruments that use a combination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, such as betting on volatility, enhancing yields or principal protection.

## Does Ribbon have a token?

Yes, Ribbon has a governance token, RBN. Please read the [RBN announcement blog post](https://ribbonfinance.medium.com/decentralizing-ribbon-governance-395950da7a6) for more details. The RBN token is [0x6123B0049F904d730dB3C36a31167D9d4121fA6B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6123b0049f904d730db3c36a31167d9d4121fa6b). The token is currently not tradable, so it is not available on any DEXes.

## What is the security of Ribbon contracts?

Our v1 Solidity contracts are audited by Quantstamp, ChainSafe and Peckshield. Users are encouraged to only risk funds that they are willing to lose.
