# Introduction to Ribbon Earn

## What is Ribbon Earn?

Ribbon Earn is a new line of yield vaults, designed to have a risk profile complementary to Theta vaults. It's an all-weather yield product that offers principal protection and uses a combination of lending and exotic options to enhance yields through exposure to short-term volatility in the market.

It employs a fully funded "twin win" strategy through which depositors can capitalize on the intra-week ETH movements in either direction, while also ensuring their capital is protected.&#x20;

Ribbon Earn is new line of vaults, so more variants will soon follow.
