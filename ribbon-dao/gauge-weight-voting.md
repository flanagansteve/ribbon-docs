# Gauge Weight Voting

The Ribbon system allows **veRBN** holders to vote how **RBN** inflation is distributed by assigning weights to each pool's "gauge"

## **Voting Rules and Information:**

* Voting will be done via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/rbn.eth).
* **veRBN** holders may spread their votes among multiple pools in gauge weight votes.
* **veRBN** holders may receive [bribes](bribes.md).&#x20;
* Gauge weight votes will be **bi-weekly,** starting Fridays at 00:00 UTC and ending on Wednesday 00:00 UTC. The Multisig will then have 2 days to manually update gauge weights accordingly. Please see figure below for the lifecycle of gauge weight vote proposals.
  * Other Ribbon governance votes will be addressed as they arise.
