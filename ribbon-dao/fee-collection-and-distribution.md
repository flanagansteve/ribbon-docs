# Fee Collection and Distribution

Ribbon Finance takes 10% performance fees and 2% management fees. For now, 100% of this is sent to the Ribbon treasury.

Some % of protocol revenue will be redirected to RBN lockers pro-rata **retroactively,** starting from veRBN launch on February 28th, 2022. This is exactly what Curve does except instead of redirecting profits from option premiums it redirects profits from [LP fees](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html#fee-distribution).

We are thinking about two approaches:

1. Take the premiums from all the vaults (ETH, WBTC, USDC) and buy back RBN from the market and distribute that to veRBN holders. On one hand this creates constant buy-pressure on RBN similar to xSUSHI. On the other hand if RBN is not doing well, the profit sharing APY will be low.
2. Take the premiums from all the vaults (ETH, WBTC, USDC) and convert it to stablecoins and distribute that to veRBN holders for reliable cash-flow. On one hand this provides reliable returns. On the other hand, there is less buy pressure for RBN on the market.

Protocol fee sharing will be available **March/April 2022**
