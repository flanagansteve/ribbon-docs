# Introduction to Ribbon Lend

Ribbon Lend can be described as an uncollateralized Aave, allowing depositors to lend unsecured to KYC/AML’d institutional market makers of their choosing with high liquidity. Ribbon Lend offers the best of both worlds between TradFi and DeFi:

* High yields from unsecured lending
* No lockups from Aave’s money market model
* Off-chain enforcement / credit underwriting
* Built-in insurance
